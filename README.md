### Here lies the greatest Reddit app that was never released

I would love to continue working on Dank, but maintaining a side project is like having two jobs. I can’t do it anymore so I’m releasing the source and archiving the project. Please read this blog post for understanding my reasons behind this decision: http://saket.me/sunsetting-dank.

The source code is a gigantic mess of a hundred different ideas barely hanging onto each other. Do not go inside expecting to see inspiration for good code. It’s quite the opposite. If anything, Dank can be an inspiration for UI ideas. Somewhat along the lines of [Nick Butcher’s Plaid](https://github.com/nickbutcher/plaid).

I have so far been able to clean up some parts of Dank and release them separately:

* [Flick](https://saket.me/flick-dismissible-images/): library for dismissing images with flick gesture
* [InboxRecyclerView](https://saket.me/inboxrecyclerview/): building expandable descendant navigation, inspired by Google Inbox
* [FluidKeyboardResize](https://saket.me/smoothly-reacting-to-keyboard/): smoothly reacting to keyboard visibility changes in Android

I’d like to open source Dank’s WYSIWYG markdown editor, but I haven’t been able to find time for it yet. I will appreciate it if someone else can help me with it.
